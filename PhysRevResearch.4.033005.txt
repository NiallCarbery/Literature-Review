                 We propose a protocol that achieves fast adiabatic transfer between two orthogonal states of a qubit by
              coupling with an ancilla. The qubit undergoes Landau-Zener dynamics, whereas the coupling realizes a time-
              dependent Hamiltonian, which is diagonal in the spin’s instantaneous Landau-Zener eigenstates. The ancilla
              (or meter), in turn, couples to a thermal bath such that the overall dynamics is incoherent. We analyze the
              protocol’s fidelity as a function of the strength of the coupling and of the relaxation rate of the meter. When the
              meter’s decay rate is the largest frequency scale of the dynamics, the spin dynamics is encompassed by a master
              equation describing dephasing of the spin in the instantaneous eigenbasis. In this regime, the fidelity of adiabatic
              transfer improves as the bath temperature is increased. Surprisingly, the adiabatic transfer is significantly more
              efficient in the opposite regime, where the timescale of the ancilla dynamics is comparable to the characteristic
              spin timescale. Here, for low temperatures the coupling with the ancilla tends to suppress diabatic transitions via
              effective cooling. The protocol can be efficiently implemented by means of a pulsed, stroboscopic coupling with
              the ancilla and is robust against moderate fluctuations of the experimental parameters.

the center of our study, where the qubit, undergoing the
Landau-Zener dynamics, is also coupled to a second quantum
system, acting as an environment. The coupling Hamiltonian              FIG. 1. Instantaneous eigenenergies of the Landau-Zener
