3.2 Energy rescaling
A natural generalization is to consider any interaction
YS (t) ⊗ XM that commutes with the system Hamiltonian
at all times, [YS (t), HS (t)] = 0. In fact, every interaction
that induces pure dephasing in the system eigenbasis is of
this form. More specifically, any interaction that does not
satisfy the commutation relation also induces relaxation
in the system eigenbasis, for the following reason: Given
